            <ul>
              <li>Creating a product that provides the end users (the player) with a pleasant and intuitive experience.</li>
              <li>Designing with accordance to budget and timeline constraints.</li>

            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2>The Story</h2>
          <div class="about-desc">
            I began my work term at <a href="https://uken.com/">Uken Games'</a> CloudBreakers team at the beginning of 2016. The game studio as a whole is around ~75-80 people, but the team I worked on only consisted of around 15 people at its peak. And of course the team was consisted of members of all disciplines, products, design, management, and of course engineers.

            When I first joined the team, the game was nearing its Alpha release at the end of February. A core part of why this was an invaluable experience for me was because I had to opportunity to engage in user research and behavior analysis for the first time in my career, but we will come back on that point later. <br><br>

            One core trait required by the studio is being able to quickly and elegantly deliver both animated and static mocks that illustrate player behavior and interactions with the game. My supervisor was instrumental in ensuring that I was appropriately exposed to different opportunities and design challenges.<br><br>

            I was able to gain the trust and respect equivalent to a full-time very quickly, and was tasked with designs of greater scope and difficulties as a result. 
          </div>

          <h2>Design Challenges</h2>
          <div class="about-desc">
            One of the core concepts of UX design requires that the system designed to be as intuitive as possible, with minimum thinking required on the user’s part when navigating through the interface and interactions. <br><br>

            Keeping these core ideas in mind, the designs needed to be simple to use, simple in implementation, potentially scalable and also delivered in a timely fashion due to the pressing timeline.<br><br>

            On a few occasions, the game design and UX design team would come into disagreement with the direction and/or the implementation of certain features. <br><br>

            Under these circumstances what usually ended up happening was collaborative brainstorm sessions. The teams would sit together in a meeting room and dissect the problem at its roots. The conversation usually revolved around why a specification or implementation is necessary to have or why it brought value to our end users. <br><br>

            In some ways UX and game designers are almost like fire and ice — game design usually wants complex game mechanics that increase the amount of meaningful decisions the players are able to make (the more stats the better, the more ways to increase those stats the better); whereas UX designers work with the fundamental principle of reducing cognitive load by simplifying workflows, mechanics, and UIs.

            One major issue that I often ran into was the consideration for the scope of designs. Often times systems designed are rendered obsolete by existing specs, and major audits are needed. The challenge in these situations would be to always consider the timeline, and finding a solution that is optimized for UX, game design, and development resources. 

            Because sometimes the "best" UX solution will take much too long to implement. Finding the sweet spot in what works for everyone requires a delicate balance. 
          </div>

          <h2>Finding the Solution</h2>
          <div class="about-desc">
            Over the span of my 4 month work term on CloudBreakers, I took leadership of and completed 40 tasks large and small. Notably, this consisted of major overhauls or completely new designs of 6 major systems in the game (Garage/Crafting, Dossier, Chat, Settings, Profile/Friends, Mission Briefing), and 12 animatic proof of concepts. <br><br>

            The overhauls and designs usually involved a series of steps:<br><br>

            <ul>
            <li><b>Identifying the problem:</b> what exactly are we trying to solve?</li>
            <li><b>Researching existing solutions:</b> how did other studios/design teams solve similar problems before?</li>
            <li><b>Identifying constraints:</b> will the existing resources allow for the overhauled specs?</li>
            <li><b>Prototyping:</b> let's build it out and get more hands-on with the design</li>
            <li><b>Iterating the solution:</b> What is not working, and how do we go about fixing it?</li>
            </ul><br>

            Here's a couple of animations and mocks that I worked on in the past four months. With images illustrating the process for some of these designs, and just the finalized mock for others. <br><br>

          <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
          <div class="about-desc">
            Being exposed to user research and user surveying methodologies for the first time, I could definitely say that I'm much more confident tackling and taking initiatives in conducting user testing sessions now.

            As well, this was my first time working with a games development studio. Due to Uken's team structures, I learned that smaller game studios operate in a way that's very similar to any agile-development based start-ups, and the same problems are always encountered. After this term though, I could say that I'm definitely more interested in UX design in the games industry, and will definitely be looking for opportunities to join other games studios in the future. 

            Big shoutouts to the CloudBreakers team for having so much faith in me! Especially to my mentor/good friend/supervisor <a href="https://brianisme.com/">Brian Lin</a>, thank you to all the advice you've given me in all aspects of life. Whether it was over coffee, stand-up, or beer, I always learned something valueable after our conversations. 

            Will I return to Uken some time in the future? Maybe? Who knows. Uken definitely was an amazing experience for me, lots of talent in the studio, and I'm interested in how the company will develop moving forward.

          <div class="about-desc">Beacons was a project I worked on in Kik's summer term HackWeek.  This web-based feature on Kik integrates with Kik codes to create a physical capture the flag game with Kik codes as the means for "capturing the flag".  Each "beacon" is hidden in a physical space for a user to find.  Once found, users can scan the beacon with their Kik code scanner to take posession of it.  The user gets points for every minute they keep posession of the beacon.  To make the game more interesting, players in posession of a beacon can spend Kik Points to lock the beacon, get a point multiplier, and obtain other strategic advantages.  
            <br/><br/>
              For this project, I was in charge of the branding, and interface design of the online web store to buy additional services for the game with Kik Points.

          Beacons won the prize for "Best Kik Points Integration", and won the overall best hack prize for summer HackWeek.

Smileys are the equivalent of emojis on Kik, and are offered in a variety of different themes and expressions.  For this project, I designed interfaces, animations, illustrations, and got to work with an awesome team of developers to bring my ideas to life.

Every day, users would be presented with a stack of offers, which would fly off the screen once completed.  When the user reaches the end of the card stack, they arrive at a clock interface counting down until the next offers will be present.  The clock interface is embedded in the background of the interface, to make it feel as though it has been below the stack of cards the entire time.
