					<h2>The Story</h2>
					<div class="about-desc">
						I began my work term at <a href="https://uken.com/" target="_blank">Uken Games'</a> CloudBreakers team at the beginning of 2016. The game studio as a whole is around ~75-80 people, but the team I worked on only consisted of around 15 people at its peak. And of course the team consisted of members of all disciplines, products, design, management, and of course engineers.

						When I first joined the team, the game was nearing its Alpha release at the end of February. A core part of why this was an invaluable experience for me was because I had to opportunity to engage in user research and behavior analysis for the first time in my career, but we will come back on that point later.<br><br>

						One core trait required by the studio is being able to quickly and elegantly deliver both animated and static mocks that illustrate player behavior and interactions with the game. My supervisor was instrumental in ensuring that I was appropriately exposed to different opportunities and design challenges.<br><br>

						I was able to gain the trust and respect equivalent to a full-time very quickly, and was tasked with designs of greater scope and difficulties as a result. 
					</div>

					<h2>Finding the Solution</h2>
					<div class="about-desc">
						Over the span of my 4 month work term on CloudBreakers, I took leadership of and completed 40 tasks large and small. Notably, this consisted of major overhauls or completely new designs of 6 major systems in the game (Garage/Crafting, Dossier, Chat, Settings, Profile/Friends, Mission Briefing), and 12 animatic proof of concepts. <br><br>

						The overhauls and designs usually involved a series of steps:<br><br>

						<ul>
							<li><b>Identifying the problem:</b> What exactly are we trying to solve?</li>
							<li><b>Researching existing solutions:</b> How did other studios/design teams solve similar problems before?</li>
							<li><b>Identifying constraints:</b> Will the existing resources allow for the overhauled specs?</li>
							<li><b>Prototyping:</b> Let's build it out and get more hands-on with the design!</li>
							<li><b>Iterating the solution:</b> What is not working, and how do we go about fixing it?</li>
						</ul><br>


						I mentioned this in the challenges section briefly earlier, part of the process for collaborative design is for UX designers to work in sync with producers, game designers, and developers. A big part of what made the workflow smooth for everyone involved had to do with the tools that were used to make the hand-off. <br><br>

						A number of UX related softwares were used to do the heavy lifting, and vastly improve the speed at which the team was able to complete and collaborate on tasks. The notably MVPs in our toolbox were Flinto and Zeplin. <br><br>

						Of course this process also involved more fundamental steps such as establishing style guides and an UI library in both Adobe CC and Sketch.<br><br>

						Flinto allowed us to quickly build out interactive (90% functional) prototypes extremely quickly, with full interaction workflows and animations. Zeplin allowed developers to get the exact measurements in CSS without having to painstakingly use the ruler tool for manual measurements in Photoshop/Illustrator. Both of these had plugins that allowed them to be directly integrated into Sketch. Biggest bang for the buck. <br><br>

						<div class="row inline-image">
							<img class="image" src="src/img/zeplin-example.gif">
							<p class="caption">In this case Zeplin helps bridge the gap between developers and designers. Fully automating hand-off process.</p>
						</div>

						Here's a couple of animations and mocks that I worked on in the past four month, with images illustrating the process. <br><br>

						<b>Step 1.</b> Working with game design to establish a logical flow for the different game components. 

						<div class="row inline-image">
							<img class="image" src="src/img/cb-pve-flowchart.png">
							<p class="caption">The enormous documented PvE ecosystem.</p>
						</div>

						<b>Step 2.</b> Establish the flow, and then have lots and lots of brainstorm sessions.
						<div class="row inline-image">
							<img class="image" src="src/img/cb-brainstorm2.jpg">
							<p class="caption">Countless ideas were born in this room...but not all of which survive.</p>
						</div>

						<b>Step 3.</b> Explore and eliminate ideas through the creation of low to mid fidelity mocks (speed is very important).
						<div class="row inline-image">
							<img class="image" src="src/img/cb-low-fidelity.png">
							<p class="caption">From sketches on paper to sketches on Sketch 3™.</p>
						</div>

						<b>Step 4.</b> Select the "best" solution candidate from the pool of low fidelity mocks, produce the high fidelity mock. Provide sound reasons to defend the design when challenged.

						</div>

						<b>Step 5.</b> Iterate! Rinse and repeat.
					</div>

					<h2>Design Challenges</h2>
					<div class="about-desc">
						One of the core concepts of UX design requires that the system designed to be as intuitive as possible, with minimum thinking required on the user’s part when navigating through the interface and interactions. <br><br>

						Keeping these core ideas in mind, the designs needed to be simple to use, simple in implementation, potentially scalable and also delivered in a timely fashion due to the pressing timeline.<br><br>

						On a few occasions, the game design and UX design team would come into disagreement with the direction and/or the implementation of certain features. <br><br>

						Under these circumstances what usually ended up happening was collaborative brainstorm sessions. The teams would sit together in a meeting room and dissect the problem at its roots. The conversation usually revolved around why a specification or implementation is necessary to have or why it brought value to our end users. <br><br>

						In some ways UX and game designers are almost like fire and ice — game design usually wants complex game mechanics that increase the amount of meaningful decisions the players are able to make (the more stats the better, the more ways to increase those stats the better); whereas UX designers work with the fundamental principle of reducing cognitive load by simplifying workflows, mechanics, and UIs. <br><br>

						One major issue that I often ran into was the consideration for the scope of designs. Often times systems designed are rendered obsolete by existing specs, and major audits are needed. The challenge in these situations would be to always consider the timeline, and finding a solution that is optimized for UX, game design, and development resources.  <br><br>

						Because sometimes the "best" UX solution will take much too long to implement. Finding the sweet spot in what works for everyone requires a delicate balance. 
					</div>

					<h2>User Testing</h2>
					<div class="about-desc">
						Luckily my work term coincided with the Alpha playtest of CloudBreakers. The UX team had concerns in some of the general game design and gameplay directions. But in order to make our arguments more concrete we required validation in the form of user feedback (not just internal). <br><br>

						The game had previously had a number of internal playtests, but the feedback received usually tends to be biased in a neutrally positive light (asking your friends and coworkers to critically and harshly evaluate your designs usually tends to be problematic from a political standpoint).<br><br>

						The UX team suggested that a closed beta would provide valuable user feedback for the studio. The playtest was designed in the form of a Longitudinal Diary user studies, and over 50 users participated in the playtest. 

						<div class="row inline-image">
							<img class="image" width="400" src="src/img/diary-spreadsheet.gif">
							<img class="image" width="400" src="src/img/typeform-survey.gif">
							<p class="caption">The massive spreadsheet of all the gathered user feedback. Over 50 users participated, and over 170 responses were recorded.</p>
						</div>

						TypeForm.com was used to produce the playtest diary questions, and we enlisted help from UserTesting.com for feedback in the form user-emotion and user-behaviour videos (along with gesture recordings). <br><br>

						I was also granted the opportunity to speak in person with some of our users. What was especially valuable for me in this experience was being able to digest and dissect their comments from both a logical and emotional standpoint.

						<div class="row inline-image">
							<img class="image" src="src/img/user-research.jpg">
							<p class="caption">We broke down the data so we could correlate commonalities between the participants before presenting the findings to the entire team.</p>
						</div>

						I won’t go into too much details into the results of the playtest, but I could say that it was immensely helpful in helping us consolidating the game and identifying what works and what needs adjustments.  <br><br>

						One major takeaway I learned from this exercise is the practice of empathy - putting myself in the user’s mindset and REALLY, I mean REALLY, understanding the user’s frustrations first-hand. A significant challenge I encountered during this exercise was to remove personal bias when reading into an user’s responses and behaviour. Stopping oneself from injecting their own narrative when analyzing the user feedback is especially important.
					</div>

					<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
					<div class="about-desc">
						Being exposed to user research and user surveying methodologies for the first time, I could definitely say that I'm much more confident tackling and taking initiatives in conducting user testing sessions now. <br><br>

						As well, this was my first time working with a games development studio. Due to Uken's team structures, I learned that smaller game studios operate in a way that's very similar to any agile-development based start-ups, and the same problems are always encountered. After this term though, I could say that I'm definitely more interested in UX design in the games industry, and will definitely be looking for opportunities to join other games studios in the future. <br><br>

						Big shoutouts to the CloudBreakers team for having so much faith in me! Especially to my mentor/good friend/supervisor <a href="http://brianisme.com/" target="_blank">Brian Lin</a>, thank you to all the advice you've given me in all aspects of life. Whether it was over coffee, stand-up, or beer, I always learned something valueable after our conversations. <br><br>

						Uken definitely was an amazing experience for me, tons of talented individuals. I'm definitely interested in how the company will develop moving forward.

					<h2>The Story</h2>
					<div class="about-desc">
						I had the opportunity to work with Roadmunk for the summer of 2015. Roadmunk is a highly talented and focused start-up based in downtown Toronto. <br><br>

						Roadmunk is an enterprise SaaS platform that enables product managers and their teams to communicate strategic roadmaps to shareholders and their organization. At its core, Roadmunk is a roadmap visualization web application. <br><br>

						Product leaders can easily input milestones, roadmap data and create unlimited pivots in real time. Roadmunk has quickly grown to server thousands of users across major organizations globally. Roadmunk's customers include Nike, Coke-Cola, Marriott Hotels, Harvard Business & Adobe. <br><br>

						I completed a variety of tasks for Roadmunk, from graphics, branding, web development, to product design. I was instrumental in ensuring the product’s success during the four months that I worked there.

					<h2>Application UX / Product Design</h2>
					<div class="about-desc">
						Roadmunk’s core mission objective was to deliver a pleasant user experience, and design for the path of least resistance. Users should get the job done with minimal conscious effort. All of Roadmunk's designs holds true to these three core philosophies.<br><br>

						<h3>3 Click Mentality</h3>
						Trying to design so that every option is less than 3 clicks away. Hovers and drags count as half clicks. Keep track of the design and try to minimize the distance. The routes should be as direct as possible.<br><br>

						<h3>Reducing Cognitive Load</h3>
						Cognitive-load is the mental strain required at any given time to process what the information/accomplish tasks. The objective is to try to reduce it as much as we can, so we can give emphasis to the roadmap info users add. <br><br>

						<h3>Tactful Transitions</h3>
						Transitions are used throughout the app. Hover over any clickable div and see this effect. The rationale behind this was to make the user feel more in tune and have a pleasant feeling navigating around the app.<br><br>

						Here are some features that I worked on during my time at Roadmunk.

						Leggo was founded in the Summer of 2015 by two of my good friends from UWaterloo. I was invited to join the team during the Autumn of 2015. At the time the application was still in its infancy, with not a lot of motions in the marketing or products aspects. The founders invited me to join the executives team as the lead products and UX designer. I led a team of 4 other designers and engineers in developing the next major iteration of the application. <br><br>

						In its core, Leggo is an event aggregation mobile platform designed for students, by students. The problem the application tried to solve is to help students find different sorts of social and community events, from frat parties to employer info sessions.<br><br>

						I handled all aspects related to the product, UX, and branding of the application.
